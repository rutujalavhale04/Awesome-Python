This was largely attributed to a few key factors:</p><ul> <li><strong>Rise in Pet Ownership:</strong> More households adopted pets, especially during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. With people staying at home, dogs became more popular as companions, driving the demand for high-quality food.</li> <li><strong>Health and Wellness Trends:</strong> Pet owners became increasingly aware of the importance of healthy, nutritious food for their pets.

Pet food brands are expanding their distribution networks and tailoring their products to local tastes.</li> <li><strong>Subscription Services and E-Commerce Growth:</strong> Subscription models for pet food deliveries, paired with the continuous growth of e-commerce, will continue to shape the industry, providing convenience and personalized food options to pet parents.</li></ul><p>According to a report from Grand View Research, the global pet food market size is expected to reach $55.4 billion by 2033, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6%.
